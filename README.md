# Resources For Female Programmers In London

The following resources are free to enter. Specific events might have a price (conference tickets, for example). Some are more active than others. Quality and activity levels will ebb and flow. I suggest you find what interests you, make some great lady friends and then get active making the community better. Give talks, run workshops, invite experts in the field!
